⚡ Performance Optimizations
React Optimizations
typescript
// Implemented:
✅ useCallback for event handlers
✅ Memoized expensive calculations
✅ Efficient re-rendering patterns
✅ Lazy loading for heavy components
✅ Debounced input handling
Flow Optimizations
typescript
// React Flow specific:
✅ Custom node types for better performance
✅ Edge optimization with custom components
✅ Viewport management for large flows
✅ Handle positioning calculations
✅ Connection validation
🔧 State Management
Zustand Store Structure
typescript
interface FlowStore {
  // Core State
  nodes: Node[]
  edges: Edge[]
  selectedNode: Node | null
  
  // Actions
  addNode: (node: Node) => void
  updateNode: (id: string, data: any) => void
  deleteNode: (id: string) => void
  onNodesChange: (changes: NodeChange[]) => void
  onEdgesChange: (changes: EdgeChange[]) => void
  onConnect: (connection: Connection) => void
  
  // Validation
  validateFlow: () => ValidationResult
  saveFlow: () => void
}
